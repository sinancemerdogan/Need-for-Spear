# Need for Spear

Need for Spear is a competitive game where two warriors race for the powerful Spear of Power. Created by the legendary magician Shazam, the game features obstacles and magical abilities. The first warrior to overcome all obstacles and reach the spear wins. Each warrior has a noble phantasm and enchanted sphere to deflect and destroy obstacles. If the enchanted sphere falls, the warrior loses a chance. With only 3 chances, the loser is deemed unworthy. The game will later include a 2-player mode with networking.
